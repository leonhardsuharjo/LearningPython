COMPUTATIONAL COST of =>\\n  - Insertion sort = depends on input size\\n  - Divide and conquer algorithm\\n    - Conquer phase = 2T(n/2)\\n    - Division phase = O(1) {Big O}\\n    - Combining phase = = O(n)\\n  - Stack\\n    - push() = O(1)\\n    - pop() = O(1)\\n    - top() = O(1)\\n    - empty() = O(1)\\n    - size() = O(1)\\n  - Binary search tree\\n    - using inorder traversal = O(n)\\n    - using tree search = O(h) #h == height\\n  - Prefix average = O(n)\\n3. Divide and conquer algorithm\\n  - split into the smallest pair of two, regroup by sorting\\n4. Prefix average = finding the average on each points (up to index 1 average is ...)\\n5. Binary search steps =>\\n    Locate a target value in a SORTED sequence\\n    - IF sequence is still unsorted, do a sequential search to examine every element\\n    - using MID = [(low+hi)/2] // all using index number\\n    - if target < data[mid],, (new) HI = mid - 1\\n    - if target > data[mid],, (new) LO = MID + 1\\n    - if LO > HI,, stop the loop\\n6. Stack = last-in, first-out\\n  - Only possible to access/remove the last inserted element\\n  - method => push() and pop()\\n7. Queue => first-in, first-out\\n  - Only possible to access/remove the first inserted element\\n  - method => enqueue() and dequeue()\\n8. Linked list\\n  - store elment in certain order\\n  - uses HEAD and TAIL\\n  - Two main types = singly and doubly\\n    - singly = only has curr and next value\\n    - doubly = curr, next, and prev\\n9. Doubly Linked List == uses both prev and head and tail and next\\n10. Trees = non linear data structure\\n  - has PARENT and CHILDREN element (all of them called as nodes)\\n    - Two nodes sharing the same parent nodes are said SIBLING\\n    – A node with NO CHILDREN nodes is said EXTERNAL\\n    – A node with one or more children nodes is said INTERNAL\\n    – External == LEAVES == LEAF\\n    – node u is an ANCESTOR of node v if u = v or u is an\\n    ancestor of the parent of v\\n    – a node v is a DESCENDANT of a node u if u is an\\n    ancestor of v\\n    - The SUBTREE of T rooted at a node v is the tree consisting of\\n    all the descendants of v in T\\n    - An edge of a tree T is a pair of nodes (u, v) such that u is\\n    parent of v or viceversa (EDGE == connection, ex: (a-->b))\\n11. Trees (details)\\n  - LEAF == node that has no children.\\n  - Left child will be SMALLER than the right node (two children system)\\n  - DEPTH == number of ANCESTORS of the node, excluding the node itself\\n    - if node == root, depth == 0\\n      - otherwise depth == 1+ (depth of parent)\\n  - Computational complexity of depth(tree, start) == O((Dstart)+1)\\n  - HEIGHT equals to ==\\n    - if node == leaf, height = 0\\n    - otherwise, height == 1+ (max of children heights)\\n    - HEIGHT of tree == HEIGHT of root\\n12. Binary tree == Tree with ONLY two children\\n  - [LEFT child < ROOT < RIGHT child]\\n  - Proper binary tree == when each node has EITHER zero or two children (no more than two)\\n  - Functions =\\n    - left()\\n    - right()\\n    - sibling()\\n  - Properties\\n    - DEPTH and HEIGHT difference\\n      - DEPTH ==  distance from TOP (or ROOT) to CURRENT (max at leaf nodes)\\n      - HEIGHT == distance from BOTTOM to CURRENT (max at root)\\n13. Trees - Preorder traversal == going through all tree element\\n  - subtrees visited in order left to right\\n    - finish to the leaf before proceeding right\\n    - uses RECURSIVE function\\n14. RECURSIVE FUNCTION\\nHow recursion ends:\\n  - When the function calls itself (e.g., preorder(tree, lc, visited)), it pauses the current call and starts executing the new one.\\n  - The function keeps calling itself on child nodes until it reaches a base case where node == None. #it returns an actual number NOT an error code\\n  - At that point, the function does not recurse further and simply returns visited.\\n  - This unwinds the recursion: each call returns back to its caller, eventually returning from the very first call.\\n15. POSTORDER != PREORDER\\n  - postorder = all the parents in the highest level is assessed first before moving down from left to right\\n  - preorder = goes down to bottom before going right\\n  - POSTORDER == BREADTH first SEARCH\\n16. inorder traversal == goes from the very left all the way to the very right\\n17. binary search tree == finding something on tree\\n  - using inorder traversal OR tree search\\n18. quicksort -- page 187\\n19. Graphs - page 202 == set of VERTICES (or nodes) connected in connections (or EDGES)\\n  - edges can be directed or undirected\\n  - two vertices joined by an edge == end vertices == end points\\n  - two edges that are connected by an edge == adjacent\\n  - edge with origin in vertex == OUTGOING\\n  - edge with destination in vertex == INGOING\\n  - PATH == as it name says\\n  - subgraph of graph G == graph H who is subset of vertices and edges of G\\n    - spanning subgraph\\n20. Depth first search == effecient method\\n21. In order traversal =>\\n  - In-order Traversal Steps\\nStart at the root node: A.\\n\\nMove to the left child of A, which is B.\\n\\nMove to the left child of B, which is D.\\n\\nD has no left child (it's a leaf), so visit D (process or print it).\\n\\nReturn to B, visit B next.\\n\\nMove to the right child of B, which is E.\\n\\nE has no left child, so visit E.\\n\\nReturn back to A, visit A.\\n\\nMove to the right child of A, which is C.\\n\\nC has no left child, so visit C.\\n\\nSince C has no right child either, traversal is done\\n\\n\""
